# Phaser Game Starter Template

This is a simple, no frills, Phaser.io game template that contains all the various elements you will need to start your new game.

After building many games, this  template was constructed as a quick, reusable starting point so I could quickly jump in to building the main game mechanics rather than worry about the game setup, states and general flow.

It contains many features that I found myself consistantly using in every project, using Google fonts and adding high scores for example.

The template includes a simple 'Keep Ups' ball game but please note this game itself is not the purpose of this repo.
